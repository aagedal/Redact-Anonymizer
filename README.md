# Redact Anonymizer

A native, Metal-accelerated anonymization effect for **Adobe Premiere Pro**,
**DaVinci Resolve**, **Final Cut Pro / Motion**, and **Adobe Photoshop**
(macOS) that obscures
image regions by stacking three independent obfuscation layers in a single
effect:

1. **Random spatial distortion** — two octaves of value noise (a base octave
   plus a finer one on a rotated lattice) warp the image by a pseudo-random
   field, destroying the pixel-to-pixel correspondence that deblurring and
   mosaic-reversal tools rely on.
2. **Gaussian blur** — removes the high-frequency detail.
3. **Mosaic** — pixelates the result, with a square, triangle, or hexagon
   tiling (a purely cosmetic choice — all three sample the same way). Each
   cell then gets a small seeded brightness offset (**Cell Noise**), so cell
   colours no longer equal the source averages that block-matching
   depixelation tools such as Depix compare against. **Colour Noise**
   optionally adds a separate offset per colour channel, shifting each cell's
   hue as well. The offsets are fixed for the whole clip rather than redrawn
   every frame, so cells do not flicker (and averaging frames cannot cancel
   them out); the Session Key still makes them new on every launch.

The layers change colour only: every pixel keeps its own alpha, so a matte
the host passes in alpha (such as a Resolve power window) keeps its exact
shape rather than being warped and pixelated along with the image. When the
host marks its images premultiplied (Resolve does), the layers run on the
un-premultiplied colour, with colour from inside the matte extended past
its edge, so no black is pulled in along the window edge; the result is
premultiplied by the original matte again.

Optionally, a **Frosted Glass** finish turns the result into a softened,
lightened and grained surface. It runs after the three layers and only
sees their output, so it changes the look without weakening anything.

Before version 2.0 the effect was called **Multi-Layer Anonymizer**. Only
the visible name changed - the internal identifiers did not, so existing
projects keep working, and the installer removes the old-named Final Cut
Pro app and template.

| Before | After (default settings) |
|---|---|
| ![before](docs/before.png) | ![after](docs/after.png) |

| Triangle mosaic | Hexagon mosaic |
|---|---|
| ![triangle](docs/shape-triangle.png) | ![hexagon](docs/shape-hexagon.png) |

**Why multiple layers?** A plain blur is a (roughly) invertible convolution, and
plain mosaic averages are increasingly recoverable with ML reconstruction. Here,
each mosaic cell samples the center of content that has been distorted; blur
can run before or after this sampling. These lossy operations remove detail,
but they do not guarantee that identifying information is unrecoverable.

## Effect parameters

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Enable Distortion / Blur / Mosaic | On | Switch a layer off to preview the others |
| Distortion Amount | 20 | Maximum displacement of the warp field (minimum 15) |
| Distortion Scale | 11 | Size of the noise features |
| Blur Radius | 20 | Gaussian radius, sigma = radius/2 (minimum 15) |
| Mosaic Block Size | 30 | Pixelation block size (minimum 21) |
| Mosaic Shape | Square | Square, Triangle, or Hexagon tiling |
| Cell Noise | 3 % | Random brightness offset per mosaic cell (up to ±25 % of full range) |
| Colour Noise | 1 % | Random hue shift per mosaic cell, brightness unchanged (up to ±25 % of full range; 2.5× with Blur After Mosaic, as that blur averages most of it away) |
| Blur After Mosaic | Off | Runs distortion → mosaic → blur to soften visible cell edges |
| Random Seed | 0 | Change for a different distortion pattern (0–16,777,215) |
| Randomize Seed | — | Button: picks a new random seed |
| Session Key | On | Mixes in an unrecorded random key that changes every time the app launches |
| Temporal Jitter | On | New distortion pattern every frame |
| Smooth Jitter | On | With Temporal Jitter: the pattern flows smoothly between frames instead of changing abruptly |
| Blackout | Off | Solid black instead of the distort/blur/mosaic stack (source alpha preserved) |
| Desaturate | 0 % | Removes colour (Rec. 709 luma), e.g. to hide skin tone or clothing colour |
| Frosted Glass | Off | Finishes the result as frosted glass: extra blur, lift toward the Frost Colour, still grain |
| Frost Amount | 40 % | How far Frosted Glass lifts the region toward the Frost Colour |
| Frost Colour | 75 % grey | Tint of the frosted glass (full white tends to be too bright) |

Enable **Blur After Mosaic** for a softer appearance with less visible tiling.
Enabling it raises Blur Radius from the default 20 to 40; customized values are
preserved. Turning it off changes 40 back to 20 and preserves other values.
Projects that still use the earlier 15/35 defaults switch between those instead.
Increase Blur Radius if cell
edges remain obvious. The default order stays
distortion → blur → mosaic; with Blur turned off, both orders match.

Pixel-space parameters are specified **at a 1080p reference** and scale with
the shorter frame dimension, so the anonymization strength is identical at
1080p, 4K, or 8K — and proxy/preview renders match the full-resolution
output automatically.

The defaults are tuned so a close-up face, where the face fills much of the
frame, loses its identifying features. Distortion Amount, Blur Radius and
Mosaic Block Size cannot be set below 15, 15 and 21 respectively; projects
saved with lower values render at the minimum. With Blur
After Mosaic on, keep Blur Radius at 28 or above. To see what each layer
contributes, switch layers off with the Enable Distortion / Blur / Mosaic
checkboxes rather than lowering the sliders, and switch them back on before
rendering.

Blackout is the zero-information option: nothing of the covered pixels
survives, so use it (with an effect mask) when the region must be provably
unrecoverable and aesthetics don't matter.

Session Key: the seed is saved in the project, so anyone with the project
file (and this open-source algorithm) could regenerate the exact warp. With
Session Key on, a random key from the system CSPRNG is mixed in. It is drawn
once per app launch and never written anywhere, so the warp cannot be
reproduced, even from the project file. The cost is that renders made in
different sessions get different patterns. With Temporal Jitter on that is
invisible (the pattern changes every frame anyway). With jitter off, the
static pattern changes between launches, and separate render processes
(e.g. Media Encoder) differ from the preview. Turn it off when renders must
be bit-identical across sessions.

Temporal Jitter trade-off: **on** prevents an attacker from treating the warp as
a fixed transform across frames (and looks "alive"); **off** gives a static
warp, which avoids any multi-frame averaging of a static background revealing
detail. For moving subjects, keep it on.

Smooth Jitter (on by default): plain Temporal Jitter draws an unrelated
pattern on every frame, which some viewers find busy. With Smooth Jitter, a
new pattern is drawn every 12 frames and the warp blends between them, with
weights chosen so the distortion strength stays constant. The warp still never repeats or
stays fixed across the clip, but neighbouring frames now share most of their
pattern, so it reads as gently flowing glass rather than flicker.

Frosted Glass: the finish blurs the anonymized result again, with a radius
of 1.75 mosaic cells. A blur that only melted the cell edges would let a
close-up face read as merely out of focus (blocked images become easier to
recognize once their edges are softened), so it also smooths away the
cell-scale shapes. It then lifts it toward the Frost Colour (75 % grey by default) by Frost
Amount and adds a
fine grain that stays still. Because it only ever sees the output of the
distortion/blur/mosaic stack, it cannot reveal anything those layers
removed. A translucent white over a merely blurred image would be no
protection at all, since it can be subtracted again; here the white
covers an already anonymized image. Note that it does not hide the
silhouette any more than the mosaic does.

## Requirements

- macOS on Apple Silicon (arm64-only by default; configure with
  `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"` for a universal build)
- Xcode Command Line Tools, CMake 3.21+
- Adobe **After Effects SDK** and **Premiere Pro SDK** (see below)
- Apple **FxPlug 4 SDK** (optional — only needed for the Final Cut Pro
  plugin; the build skips it when the SDK is absent)
- Adobe **Photoshop plugin SDK** (optional — only needed for the Photoshop
  plugin; the build skips it when the SDK is absent)
- Premiere Pro with the renderer set to *Mercury Playback Engine GPU
  Acceleration (Metal)* for the GPU path; *Software Only* uses the CPU path
  (identical output, verified to ~1e-7)

## SDKs

The `sdk/` folder contains vendored Adobe SDK headers for local development
convenience. They are Adobe-licensed and **must not be redistributed** — the
folder is git-ignored on purpose. For a clean setup, download the official
SDKs from the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console/servicesandapis)
(Premiere Pro SDK, After Effects SDK, and optionally the Photoshop plugin
SDK; free with an Adobe ID) and point CMake at them:

```sh
cmake -B build \
  -DAE_SDK_PATH=/path/to/AfterEffectsSDK \
  -DPR_SDK_PATH=/path/to/PremiereProSDK
```

Both paths refer to the SDK root that contains `Examples/`. The Premiere SDK's
`Examples/Projects/GPUVideoFilter/Utils` (for `PrGPUFilterModule.h`) is picked
up automatically. The Photoshop SDK is looked for at `sdk/photoshop/pluginsdk`
(override with `-DPS_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pluginsdk`, the folder containing
`photoshopapi/`).

## Build & install

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
./scripts/install.sh   # copies to /Library/.../Adobe/Common/Plug-ins/7.0/MediaCore (sudo)
```

Restart Premiere Pro. The effect appears in the Effects panel under
**Video Effects → Aagedal → Redact Anonymizer**. To limit it to a face or
plate, use Premiere's built-in effect masks in the Effect Controls panel
(ellipse/pen mask + tracking), like with any other effect.

### DaVinci Resolve (OpenFX)

The same build also produces `build/Anonymizer.ofx.bundle`, an OpenFX plugin
with identical parameters and output, GPU-accelerated via the same Metal
kernels. Install with:

```sh
./scripts/install_ofx.sh   # copies to /Library/OFX/Plugins (sudo)
```

Restart Resolve; the effect appears in **OpenFX → Filters → Aagedal**
(Color page and Edit page). Combine it with a power window + tracker on the
Color page to follow a face. The OFX SDK and Blackmagic's Support library are
vendored under `ofx/openfx/` (BSD licensed, redistributable). The OFX plugin
should also load in other OFX hosts (Nuke, Vegas, Flame), though only Resolve
has been targeted; non-Metal hosts use the CPU path.

### Final Cut Pro / Motion (FxPlug 4)

With the [FxPlug 4 SDK](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=FxPlug)
installed, the build also produces `build/Redact Anonymizer.app` — an
FxPlug wrapper app carrying the effect as an XPC service, plus the Motion
template FCP needs (bundled in the app's Resources). Install with:

```sh
./scripts/install_fxplug.sh   # copies to /Applications, registers, installs the template
```

Launching the app once registers the plugin with PluginKit and copies the
Motion template into `~/Movies/Motion Templates.localized/`. Restart Final
Cut Pro; the effect appears in the Effects browser under
**Aagedal → Redact Anonymizer**. Use FCP's Draw Mask/Shape Mask on the
effect to confine it. Notes:

- **Final Cut Pro never lists raw FxPlug filters** — they only appear
  through a published Motion template (this is how all FxPlug products
  ship). End users do not need Motion; the pre-published template in
  `fcp/templates/` is installed for them. Re-publish the template in Motion
  only if the parameter set changes.
- The build signs with your best available identity (Developer ID, then
  Apple Development, then ad-hoc; override with `SIGN_IDENTITY=`). The XPC
  service **must** be signed with the sandbox entitlement — PluginKit
  silently ignores unsandboxed plugins.
- FxPlug renders out-of-process: FCP hands the plugin IOSurface-backed Metal
  textures; a copy-in kernel and an output render pass bridge those to the
  same shared buffer kernels used by the other two hosts.

### Photoshop

With the Photoshop plugin SDK in place, the build also produces
`build/AnonymizerPS.plugin` — a classic filter plugin sharing the exact same
pass pipeline (CPU path). Install with:

```sh
./scripts/install_ps.sh   # copies to /Library/.../Adobe/Plug-Ins/CC (sudo)
```

Restart Photoshop; the filter appears under **Filter → Aagedal →
Redact Anonymizer…** and works on RGB and Grayscale documents at 8, 16,
and 32 bits per channel, respecting selections. Parameter values carry the
same 1080p-reference semantics as the video hosts, scaled by the document's
shorter dimension. The filter is not yet recordable with parameters in
Actions (it reruns with its last-used values instead). Every run uses a fresh
random seed; the dialog preview shows the same seed the final render uses.

A ready-made action (`ps/actions/`) is bundled: it duplicates the current
layer as a smart object, applies the anonymizer as a smart filter, adds an
inverted (hidden) mask, and selects a white brush — so you just paint where
the anonymization should appear. The installer imports it into the Actions
panel automatically (by opening the `.atn` once); it is also copied into
each Photoshop's `Presets/Actions` for the Classic Actions panel's flyout
menu, and kept next to the plugin so it can be re-imported any time by
double-clicking. Branded editions get a rebranded copy generated at build
time by `scripts/make_ps_action.py`.

### Installer package

To distribute instead of installing directly, build an installer package
containing all plugins (each selectable at install time):

```sh
./scripts/make_pkg.sh  # -> build/RedactAnonymizer-<version>.pkg
```

The pkg installs the plugins system-wide. For recipients outside your own
machine, sign it (`SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Installer: ..."
./scripts/make_pkg.sh`) and notarize (`xcrun notarytool submit ... --wait`,
then `xcrun stapler staple`); unsigned packages downloaded from the internet
are blocked by Gatekeeper until right-click → Open.

### Branded editions

The effect name, category, bundle identifiers, and installer branding are
set at configure time from `editions/<name>.cmake` (default: `oss`, the
Redact Anonymizer). To build a custom-branded edition, copy
`editions/oss.cmake` to `editions/yourname.cmake`, change the values
(generate fresh UUIDs for the FxPlug entries), and configure with
`-DANON_EDITION=yourname` into its own build directory:

```sh
cmake -B build-yourname -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DANON_EDITION=yourname
cmake --build build-yourname
./scripts/make_pkg.sh build-yourname
```

Differently-branded builds share every line of algorithm code, render
identically, and can be installed side by side. All `scripts/*.sh` accept
the build directory as their first argument (default `build`).

## How it works

The algorithm lives in `shared/` and is compiled into all four host plugins:

- `shared/AnonymizerAlgo.h` — the CPU passes, noise/hash functions, and the
  parameter ranges/defaults, host-independent.
- `shared/AnonymizerKernel.h` — the MSL kernels, embedded as a string and
  compiled at runtime on the GPU device the host hands us. Handles 16-bit
  half and 32-bit float frames. The noise functions mirror the C++ exactly so
  CPU and GPU renders are interchangeable (verified to ~1e-7).

**Premiere Pro** (`src/`): a standard AE-style effect (`EffectMain`) paired
with a Premiere GPU filter (`xGPUFilterEntry`) in the same binary — the
pattern used by Adobe's `SDK_ProcAmp` sample; Premiere binds the GPU filter to
the effect through the PiPL. Per frame the GPU path encodes four compute
dispatches with no CPU readbacks: `distort → blur H → blur V → mosaic` (or
`distort → mosaic → blur H → blur V` with Blur After Mosaic),
ping-ponging through two temp buffers allocated per render and released by
the command buffer's completion handler (renders overlap and vary in size,
so instance-cached buffers would race).

**DaVinci Resolve** (`ofx/`): an OpenFX image effect built on Blackmagic's
OFX Support library, following their `GainPlugin` sample. Resolve passes
Metal command queues and buffer-backed images; the same four kernels run with
temp buffers allocated per render.

**Final Cut Pro** (`fcp/`): an FxPlug 4 plugin — an XPC service inside a
wrapper app, following Apple's Xcode template. The host provides
IOSurface-backed textures, bridged to the shared buffer kernels by a small
copy-in compute kernel and a fullscreen-quad output pass.

`Random Seed`, frame number, `Temporal Jitter`, and the optional session key
feed the identical 32-bit seed derivation on every path, so all hosts, GPU
and CPU, produce the same anonymization for the same settings (with Session
Key off).

## Anonymization notes (honest caveats)

- Set parameters generously. If the mosaic blocks are large relative to the
  face (as in the screenshot), identity recovery from the image itself is not
  realistic. Tiny values (e.g. blur 3 px, mosaic 4 px, distortion 2 px) are
  cosmetic, not protective.
- The effect protects the *pixels you cover*. Reflections, shadows, voice,
  clothing, tattoos, and context still identify people.
- Export the anonymized render and share only that. Project files reference
  the original media.
- The warp is keyed by the seed but the algorithm is public; protection comes
  mainly from the information destroyed by blur + mosaic after displacement.
  The session key removes the one shortcut that remains (regenerating the
  exact warp from a leaked project file), but it is not a substitute for
  generous settings.

## License

MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). The vendored OpenFX SDK and Support library
under `ofx/openfx/` are BSD-licensed by The Open Effects Association and
Blackmagic Design (see `ofx/openfx/LICENSE`). The Adobe and Apple SDKs
required to build are **not** included and are covered by their own license
terms (see the SDKs section above).

## Extending to Windows

The CPU path is already portable. For GPU on Windows, add CUDA/DirectX
variants of the kernels (see Adobe's `SDK_ProcAmp` sample for the CUDA
scaffolding) and a `.rc`/`PiPLtool` step for the PiPL; `Anonymizer_GPU.mm`
would split into a shared host file plus per-API dispatch.

## Regression checks

After configuring with the SDK paths above, build and run the checks with:

```sh
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The CPU checks cover both processing orders, all mosaic shapes, zero and
fractional blur radii, desaturation, cell and colour noise, and small or odd frame sizes. When the Photoshop SDK is
available, the Metal checks also compare GPU output with the CPU reference;
these require access to a Metal device. Set `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF` to omit tests.
